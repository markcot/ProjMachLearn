# Assessment Project

**Author:** Mark Cotter
**Email:**  g00376335@gmit.ie

This is my README file for the GMIT module Machine Learning and Statistics.

***

This project has been implemented in a Jupyter Notebook [1] using the Python programming language [1]. Jupyter Notebook comes as part of the part the Anaconda [3] distribution of Python. Jupyter software is also available from the Jupyter website [1].

The Jupyer Notebook containing the assessment is called **"Project.ipynb"** and is included in this GitHub [4] repository. A local copy of this reposition can be downloaded to your PC noting the requirement of the license of use included in the repository.

Having the required Jupyter software [1] installed on your PC, you can open the Jupyter Notebook from a command line or Terminal in the folder/directory where the local copy of the repository is stored. The command to open the notebook is **jupyter notebook**. With Jupyter Notebook open in your browser clicking on the file **"Tasks.ipynb"** will open the notebook in another tab.

When opening the **"Project.ipynb"** file, it is a good idea to use the command **"Restart & Run All"** from **"Kernel"** menu to refresh all the notebook cells, code and displays. Further guidance is available from the Jupyter website [1].

This project involved estimating power output of wind turbine based on a machine learning model built from a wind "wind speed" versus "power output" dataset called "powerproduction.txt" included in this repository.
